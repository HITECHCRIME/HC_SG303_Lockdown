## Lyrics

```
Carry on the rage, 
I'm ready for the roll out
Steady in the motion, 
definition of a lockdown 
Clear lil savage, notion Imma ease off nothing


right this moment is what I got inside 
only reason why I'm hardly trying to be found

Mindful state for the soul


Dizzy boy lost in the bliss of the words,
really    kills   chains
to find my soul

Addy in my conscious, 
so you know I’m gonna pop out
Walking out the coffin, 
I’m about to hold the block down
Pvssy rapper talking, 
I’m about to bring the Glock, 
saying if you not a killer 
then your brother getting shot down
*Doo doo doo doo* Lil b!tch you getting shot up
Pullup in the coup and I’m about to go and knock it’s top down
Talking like a rat, lil b!tch you a cop, when I’m rolling down the block stay inside, it’s a lockdown/


Yeah aye
I’m with the gang, Pvssy boy talking we taking your chain away/
I’m leaving bullets up inside your throat, if you hang with the ops imma fvck up your day/
Came with a pole on me, I keep his soul on me, give me the smoke all these artists are fake/
Hand on the scope and my eye on the stick if the gangs on the mask I ain’t catching a case/
Big 40k in this b!tch shouting “free all my brothers”, got family up inside the cage/
747 I keep all my bandits around me, I only converse with the gang/
He want a feature then he better pay me, if he ain’t on time then that boy isn’t safe/
Ride with a blade on my strap, I ain’t playing o games, Pvssy boy get the fvck out my face/
I keep that thing out, knocking they tops and I’m shooting his teeth out/
fvck up his day make his shawty a widow, I shoot out they window and making them spin out/
Open her mouth shawty want me to spit down it, dance on my dick she been pulling the blicks out/
She want a boy with some enemies, I’ve got some enemies, kill em I never get hit now/
Yuh aye
fvck an imposter, he got that Glock but that boy ain’t no robber/
Dance with the devil I turn to a monster, I lay out the money and make em an offer/
Camo my body, my Glock in my starter/
Ash in my skull, leave my marks on my armor/
I want the smoke, I ain’t scared of no Pvssy rappers, I’ve been shooting at thugs that go harder/
b!tch where they at? If I’m on the block alone b!tch you know I’m always watching my back/
I keep the strap on me, rag on my SKULLY, a gun on my ribs and I doubled the stack/
Click clack, knocking at your body, no cap/
Flip that, walking out the coffin no lack/
Sit back, imma pull the knife up out the pack, put it up inside his throat, he ain’t ever coming back/

Addy in my conscious so you know I’m gonna pop out
Walking out the coffin I’m about to hold the block down
Pvssy rapper talking, I’m about to bring the Glock, saying if you not a killer then your brother getting shot down
*Doo doo doo doo* Lil b!tch you getting shot up
Pullup in the coup and I’m about to go and knock it’s top down
Talking like a rat, lil b!tch you a cop, when I’m rolling down the block stay inside, it’s a lockdown/
